Question 1:
Did you choose to go with the ORM or raw SQL approach? What was the reason for your choice?

I went with the ORM method, because after the lectures I didn't feel I understood it well, and this was an opportunity to test and build my understanding.

Question 2:
What endpoints (URLs and HTTP verb/methods) did you choose to implement in your Flask application, including any special details? 

At the moment, i have created get/post/delete/put+patch endpoints for equipment types, as well as index. 

Question 3:
Brainstorm and describe some potential endpoints that you could implement in the future, that make sense for your application. 

I would like to add one endpoint that navigates different tables, like "give all pump_models (entity) sold by a vendor(entity)"

Question 4:
What challenges did you face with the Flask implementation for your portfolio project this week, and did you learn anything new from these challenges?

So many challenges. You could teach courses on each framework/module. I got stuck on a lot of little things, but thats how you learn.

 I am still not sure when its best to use flask-SQLalchemy queries vs SQLalchemy queries. Also I found that I am rewriting a lot of code on each API, so I think i can consolidate these into single files. For example, get all data for a pump is basically the same query as get all data for a motor.
